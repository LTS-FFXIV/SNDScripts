-- This is the big one, automating Emanation Extreme to allow auto farming clears for Tank achivement progress.
-- Requires RotationSolver and visland, with RS set to not turn off Auto status
-- Requires Automaton by Jaksuhn with auto queue and autoleave enabled (offloaded that stuff from the LUA to the plugin. If you dont know where to get it, i mean, how did you find this script)
-- Currently working on updating RotationSolver to handle Vril use so hopefully one day this can devolve back into Autowalky

-- GDI i forgot to mention you need to set duty action I to Insert in keybinds

-- Local value to track how many times Vril has been executed, just as a sanity check
local castCount = 0
-- Local value to track the maximum distance to the specific enemy to move towards
